    "# Diabetes Prediction Model\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce adequate insulin or when the body is unable to effectively use the insulin produced. \n",
    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "According to the World Health Organization, there was a 3% increase in age standardized mortality rates from diabetes between 2000 and 2019. In lower income countries it increased to 13%. There are two types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is also known as insulin-dependent and is characterized by deficient insulin production by the body. Patients suffering from this require daily administration of insulin. Type 2 diabetes affects the body's use of insulin and leads to high levels of blood sugar. Factors affecting type 2 diabetes include: overweight, genetics, lack of exercise. Keeping a healthy lifestyle is a key component in keeping diabetes away.\n",
    "### Business Problem\n",
    "There are certain health indicators that could assist someone in knowing how susceptible they are to suffering from diabetes. Genetics play a role as well as other factors such as lifestyle which includes eating habits, smoking, and exercise. Early intervention is key and would help give preventive care to individuals at high risk and ultimately reduce the number of deaths from diabetes.\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "#### Patients\n",
    "This includes individuals potentially at risk of suffering from diabetes. This model would help them be aware of their situation and take the necessary steps to address it i.e improve their lifestyle, quit smoking e.t.c\n",
    "#### Healthcare Providers\n",
    "Hospitals, clinics, personal doctors fall under this category. Early detection of diabetes goes a long way in managing the disease and healthcare providers can develop the right treatment plan for individuals suffering from the disease.  Through this prediction model patients are able to receive personalized treatment plans.\n",
    "### Health Insurance Companies \n",
    "By identifying populations at high risk of suffering diabetes, insurance companies are able to come up with the right coverage and support for diabetes management particularly in lower income areas.\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The primary goal is to create a diabetes prediction model that can be used to predict the individuals at risk of suffering from diabetes. By doing this, individuals are able to get early preventive care to reduce the impact of diabetes.\n",
    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "The dataset used in this project is sourced from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset/data. It contains 100,000 rows and 9 columns. The 9 columns are:\n",
    "- Gender\n",
    "- Age\n",
    "- Hypertension\n",
    "- Heart disease\n",
    "- Smoking history\n",
    "- BMI\n",
    "- HbA1c- level (average blood sugar level over the last 2-3 months)\n",
    "- Blood Glucose level\n",
    "- Diabetes\n",
    "\n",
    "All these features play a role in determining the risk of an individual suffering from diabetes. Based on this dataset we will be able to conclude whether an individual is at risk of getting diabetes or not."
